Resume Data Iteration Project

   -  This project demonstrates how to dynamically display resume data on a webpage using JavaScript loops.
   
   -  It iterates over an object containing personal and professional information, showing how to use different types of loops like for, for...in, for...of, and forEach.


1. index.html :

   - This file contains the structure of the webpage and links to the external script.js and styles.css files.

2. script.js :

    - This JavaScript file contains the resume data in the form of an object.
    
    - It also contains code that iterates through the data using different loop types (for, for...in, for...of, and forEach) and appends the information to the HTML document dynamically.

3. styles.css :

    - A simple CSS file for basic styling of the webpage, ensuring the output looks clean and readable.

4. How to Run :

    - Option 1: Open the HTML file directly

         Open the index.html file in any web browser by double-clicking it.

         The resume data will display dynamically on the page.

    - Option 2: Run with Live Server (Recommended)
 
         Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

         Install the Live Server extension if you haven't already.

         Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server".
